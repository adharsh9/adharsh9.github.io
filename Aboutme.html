                          Talking about my daily life. I have a lot of interests among which i priotorize playing piano and photography the most. 
                          As for my programing history, i started to code first during my cambridge A levels. Since then i have been back and forth with different 
                          programming languages, scripting languages. In addition i also try to make my own designs from adobe illustrator.
