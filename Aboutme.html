                          Since, August 2017, i have been studying Computer Science in the University of Louisiana Monroe.
                          This portfolio was made by myself from scratch with the help of online sources like w3schools, stackOverflow
                          Talking about my daily life. I have a lot of interests among which i priotorize playing piano and photography the most. 
                          As for my programing history, i started to code first during my cambridge A levels. Since then i have been back and forth with different 
                          programming languages, scripting languages. In addition i also try to make my own designs from adobe illustrator. 
                      <br>
                      Besides being a student priotorizing my future in computer science.
                      I love to take photos specially landscapes which has resulted in improvement of my skills with several applications used to edit photos and videos. I ocassionaly play piano too.
